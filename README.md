### Goal

This is a simple application to fetch github repositories based on github API. I coded this project to practice on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, and AJAX in real project.

### Benefits

Here are some ideas to benefit from this project:

- Take this project as a task and try to make it, and if you could not do a specific section, see how i make it in the source code (use comments to reach this section).
- Extract code of specific section and use it in your project.
- Review source code to see how other people code their projects.
- Edit on this project after studying its code well, to know how to work in pair-programming with other people
- Upgrade this project, and add your own sections or pages
